As the college couldn&rsquo;t satisfy the aspirations of a large number of students opting for B.Com degree course, a parallel section was started in 1994 under self finance stream. On public demand, the college introduced M.Com degree course in 2002-03 under self finance stream. As an extension activity the department offers a coaching program for Cost &amp; Works Accountant Course from 2006 onwards, with a tie-up with Nellai Chapter of Cost &amp; Works Accountants, Tirunelveli. With the funding of UGC a Diploma Certificate Course as Stock Matket is offered.<\/p>"}
